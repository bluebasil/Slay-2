# Slay-2
Proof of concept off a spherical search made completly from hexagons

Written in python3

to setup:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

to run:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

Just a proof-of-concept, not a complete product.

press `enter` to load a saved map
press `backspace` to save your map (will overwrite the current one, probably, oh well)
press `g` to toggle between globe and flat mode.

left click on a tile to change its color.
right click on a tile to draw the shortest path from the highlighted tile to this on - not including blue/water tiles. (just a fun addition)
