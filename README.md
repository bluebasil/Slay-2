press `enter` to load a saved map
press `backspace` to save your map (will overwrite the current one, probably, oh well)
press `g` to toggle between globe and flat mode.

right click on a tile to draw the shortest path from the highlighted tile to this on - not including blue/water tiles. (just a fun addition)
